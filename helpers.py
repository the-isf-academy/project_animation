# Helpers
# By Chris Proctor
# ----------------
# A mishmash of useful functions. Feel free to use these in your own projects if they are helpful to you.

# This module contains some fancy code that we don't expect you to understand
# yet. That's ok--as long as we know how to use code, we don't have to
# understand everything about it. (Do you understand everything about
# MacOS?) Check out the README for documentation on how to use this code.

# Of course, if you want to dig into this module, feel free. You can ask a
# teacher about it if you're interested.

from itertools import chain, cycle

def fly(x,y):
    "Moves forward to (x,y) without drawing."
    penup()
    goto(x,y)
    pendown()


class no_delay:
    "A context manager which causes drawing code to run instantly"

    def __enter__(self):
        self.n = tracer()
        self.delay = delay()
        tracer(0, 0)

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        update()
        tracer(self.n, self.delay)


# =============================================================================
# 💻 YOU MAY ADD MORE HELPER FUNCTIONS BELOW 💻 #
#      - you may include other functions from the Drawing package
#      - write your own custom helper functions
