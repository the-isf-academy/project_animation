## Intial Contents
This is the starter code for [Project 0: Animation](http://cs.fablearn.org/courses/cs9/unit00/project). 
Here's what is included:

- `README.md` You're looking at it, or at least the formatted version. (Click "raw" to see the unformatted version.) Every project has a README explaining what it is.
- `project.py` When this is run, it should draw your project. (If your project is well-organized, there might not be much code in `project.py`. Instead, it might import functions from other modules.)
- `settings.py` the configuration file for your animation. You should be able to change the settings and effect the animation.
